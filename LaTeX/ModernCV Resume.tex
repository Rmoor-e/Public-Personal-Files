when I was 15 at a mixed martial arts center. Later, I left my MMA
gym to join a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu gym for several years.}

\cvitem{Team Sports}{Competitive hockey was the center-point sport I attended over my
life, and the team building, communication and leadership skills has
translated well into my career life.}

\cvitem{Solo Sports}{A family member taught me snowboarding, and since those lessons
I've become proficient. Also, weight lifting has been a long-term
hobby until I suffered an injury.}

I visited London, Paris, Rome, Assisi, and the Vatican. A highlight
from the trip was being present during Pope Francais' election.}

Through many highs and lows, I've been working tirelessly towards
this moment. My interest in medicine began when I was eighteen years
old and completed my paramedic training in Nova Scotia, Canada. As
my introduction to emergency medicine, it ignited a fire inside of
me that would lead to a long road of learning and growth.

In 2015, I moved from my hometown in Nova Scotia to our provincial
capital, where I began my training to become a Primary Care Paramedic.
Initially, I felt overwhelmed and nervous about my competency in the
course, as the passing grade was 80\%, with only three chances of
rewriting before you were removed from class. I continued with my
training, becoming profoundly engaged and active in work both inside
and outside of the classroom. As I progressed in my career, and through
writing a novel, I developed the technical skills required to provide
emergency medical care, as well as the skills to communicate with
clarity and precision. After convocating from my paramedic college,
I joined a platoon in Northern Nova Scotia, which has been a life-changing
experience, filled with enthusiasm, empathy and sadness \textemdash{}
some saved, and some lost.

Throughout my career, I have developed strong leadership skills and
the ability to obtain and maintain control in situations when required.
I have exceptional critical thinking skills and the ability to analyze
and synthesize responses to life and death situations quickly. I also
discovered that as necessary as the technical skills are, compassion
and empathy are a large part of patient care. I have a history of
being a strong advocate for people with complex life histories including:
neglect, trauma, mental illness, abuse, and addiction. I feel it is
incredibly important to treat every person with the same compassion
and respect you would give to your parents. In our discipline of medicine
and patient care, we all make life-changing differences in people's
lives, not just through providing for their medical needs, but how
we treat and care for them as a person. I continued to be determined
to my work in a way that balances a holistic and allopathic approach,
taking into account their life story and the impact of their experiences
that brought them to where they are today.

The longer I have practiced as a paramedic, the more I felt compelled
to become a physician. From interacting with physicians who I've worked
closely with over the years, I became allured to expanding my knowledge
and scope to better my patient's lives. Shortly before I started my
continuing education, I became apart of the Dalhousie EMS-PEP group,
where we revise current peer-reviewed research so that we can edit
our clinical guidelines to treat our patients best. In 2018, my studies
became more serious, attaining the necessary prerequisites for medical
school initially through distance learning, and ultimately committing
to university full-time, while still contributing to our clinical
research. Having the privilege to advocate and improve the quality
of life for the people I see further inspired my desire to become
a physician. As the physician's eyes and ears, we work together to
provide a care plan for the patient, often collaborating during complex
scenarios. Some of these scenarios include pre-hospital palliative
care, cardiac thrombolysis reperfusion therapy, and episiotomies in
the case of a breech delivery. I am continually impressed and in awe
of their wisdom, and their actions inspire me every day to pursue
the path of becoming a physician myself.

This year marks my 5th anniversary as a paramedic. My consistent progress
towards clinical knowledge has increased my interest in all aspects
of patient care. Working in multidisciplinary teams has given me first-hand
experience of how health care professionals and community services
contribute, both individually and as a team. I want to advance my
clinical skills and medical knowledge, which will enable me to help
my patients over the long term. I want to have the knowledge and ability
to advocate for my patients as much as possible, to save lives, increase
their quality of life, and reduce their suffering.

As a student with previous experience in the medical field, I will
contribute to my student community by helping and leading others from
the expertise I have developed in my career. I have precepted and
mentored students throughout my career, and enjoy working collaboratively
in a team environment. I have spent years working toward this moment;
I am ready to take the next step in Ireland.
